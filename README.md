# Drawing for Kids 0–3Y

Repository for the Drawing for Kids 0–3Y application.

The app is distributed via [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.jaro.drawing) or get the APK [here](https://github.com/jmalenko/DrawingForKids/tree/master/artifact/release).

## Description

The app is focused on little kids – each finger draws a line on the screen. There is even no color selector (the line color is chosen randomly from a curated list of basic colors ("you can name the colors"). The app prevents most of the attempts on leaving the app, including interactions with the Android system (status bar, navigation bar, lock screen, pressing home key...).The drawing canvas is cleared upon a gesture – rotate the devise by 90 degrees and back in 3 seconds. The drawings are saved to Pictures/DrawingForKids directory in internal storage.

You can enjoy the quiet moments when the kid is focused on drawing. No "mama, help me" shouting, no interruptions.

Note: The only way to quit the app is from the status bar notification.
